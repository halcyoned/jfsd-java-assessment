What did you like about this project?
It was really challenging. Base code is already there, so I think it gives us a taste of what debugging/building upon existing code is like.

What did you struggle with in this project?
Throwing exceptions and try/catch. Had trouble understanding where in the code would throw the exception and how to try/catch (e.g. method throws exception but try/catch is when executing the method in main).

What would make your experience with this assessment better?
It would help a lot if a description of the methods to be coded can be added. Currently, the methods to be coded were simply listed without any clue as to what their functions are and what they are supposed to do, so there is a lot of guesswork and it is very open to self-interpretation when it comes to what we think the functions are supposed to do.
TLDR: the requirements of the methods to be coded can be described better :)
